# SHOE PRODUCT PREVIEW
- I created this simple quick view like page for a pair of shoe to train my `css` styling and simple animations.

# CONTENTS:
- The `html` page.
- The `css` styling for the page.
- The pic of the shoe in preview.
- The pic of the shopping cart in the preview card.

- The page has some animation interactions when hovering over the shoe or the shapes on the card.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
- Download the file.
- Extract the files.
- Open the `MainPage.html` file in your browser.
- Enjoy!
